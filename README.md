# Mortierellaceae_VOCs
Co-cultivation of Mortierellaceae with Pseudomonas helmanticensis affects both their growth and volatilome

This project contains the analytical scripts and data of the above mentioned manuscript, published in Scientific Reports (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29134-6). They are part of the supplement. The entire supplement consists of figures, tables, scripts and datasets. This project contains scripts and data only. Please refer to the manuscript and its supplement for further information. Please feel free to contact us if there are any queries.
In total, there are three scripts that (i) analyse the growth data of the cultures, (ii) analyse the volatilomes of the cultures, and (iii) model the volatilomes data and correlate the PTR-ToF-MS data to GC-MS data in order to confirm compound identity.
Please note that in the second script there are some RObjects created that are required for running the third script. In other words, prior to running the third script, please run the second one.
Data can be found in the data folder.
